# Covid-Data-Analysis
Project Idea from Alex The Analyst. 

### Project Description
Having lived through a global pandemic, I can't help but to dive into metrics that value the most to us humans - morality. I created this project to analyze, visualize, and to make insights pulled from [this](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) dataset. 

Technologies used:
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Tableu Public

Learning:
- This project is designed to be an introduction to data analytics. I've chosen to practice a typical workflow that a data analyst would utilize on their day to day basis.
	- Experience the 5 steps of data analysis from defining the project, collecting data, cleaning data, analyzing and interpreting results.
